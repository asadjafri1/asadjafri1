My GitHub profile features just some of the coolest technologies and projects I've had a chance to work on. I'm passionate about leveraging the hottest technologies within machine learning and AI, particularily with a focus on AI explainability techniques. I'm driven to maximize stakeholder value with the models I create, and model explainability is my passion, where I can truly hone in on communicating technical concepts to otherwise non-technical audiences. Message me on here or on Linkedin: (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jafriut/), and let's keep the conversation going!
