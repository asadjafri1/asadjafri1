### Leverage your machine learning and data to produce tangible business outcomes with Asad, the machine learning engineer from UT Austin who just has a dogged passion for ML model explainability! üëã

Here's a little about me:

‚óè Data Science and Informatics major at UT Austin, graduating in May 2024

‚óè Awarded Killam Fellowship and selected as a Fulbright Canada Scholar to pursue specialized study in applied AI/ML at McMaster University in Canada, where I constructed a Random Forest ML model to predict the diabetes diagnosis of 700 hospital patients

‚óè Interned as a Data Engineering and Machine Learning intern at a Big 4 Consulting competitor based in the San Francisco Bay Area in the Summer of 2023, where I crafted ML regression models, harnessed the power of data within MS Synapse and Fabric Data Lake, and presented artificial intelligence initiatives to senior management

‚óè Interned as a Software Engineer in Web3 Blockchain at a fintech in the New York City Metropolitan Area, where I developed a Web3 Ethereum faucet to support asset digitalization efforts at the firm

My GitHub profile features just some of the coolest technologies and projects I've had a chance to work on. I'm passionate about leveraging the hottest technologies within machine learning and AI, particularily with a focus on AI explainability techniques. I'm driven to maximize stakeholder value with the models I create. ML model explainability is my passion, where I can truly hone in on communicating technical concepts to otherwise non-technical audiences.
